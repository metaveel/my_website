## *About Metavee*

I am **Metavee (Jenny) Luangthawornkul** from Bangkok, Thailand. I graduated from *Chulalongkorn University* majoring in Financial Analysis and Investment. I also went for an exchange program at Nanyang Technological University, Singapore. 

At Chulalongkorn, I was able to secure *three* different internships: 1) Product and Investment Strategy Intern at Asset Plus Fund Management, 2) Summer Intern at Bualuang Securities, and 3) Segmentation Intern at Krungthai Bank Public Company Limited. Those internships helped me to realize that I would like to pursue a career that comprises of investment and corporate finance such as M&A; therefore, I decided to join *9Basi*, a boutique PE firm with a focus on real estate and distressed assets in Thailand.


Having always been passionate about investing and self-motivated, I decided to pursue my Masters in Financial Analysis degree at London Business School
I have come to LBS to explore opportunities to be connected with world-renowned PE firms, and amazing people throughout the School. I would also to share my network, and passion in investment to everyone!

During my free time, I love to hike and I have been meditating every day for almost 15 years!
