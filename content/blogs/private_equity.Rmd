## An ex private equity analyst at 9Basil

My biggest achievement during my time at 9Basil is when I was a deal leader in both the second tranche acquisition of Ngern Tid Lor Public Company Limited (SET Ticker: TIDLOR) from *CVC Capital Partners* (Deal size $21m) and share purchase from the existing shareholder (Deal size $47m). The transaction happened right before the Company went public. It is the first deal that I was a deal leader where I got opportunities to work with several stakeholders and be part of the deal from origination to execution. 


Ngern Tid Lor (“TIDLOR”) is publicly listed on the Stock Exchange of Thailand (“SET”) under TIDLOR as of May 10th, 2021 with a market capital of USD 2.6 billion at IPO price. The Company was the largest IPO in the finance and banking category and the 5th largest IPO history of the SET.At the IPO price, 9Basil generated a return of 3.4x with an IRR of 167%
