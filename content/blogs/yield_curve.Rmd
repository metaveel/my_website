The following graphs are about Yields on US rates as well as inverted yield curve and its predictive power with respect to recessions. Many articles and commentators think that, e.g., [*Yield curve inversion is viewed as a harbinger of recession*](https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2019-08-14/u-k-yield-curve-inverts-for-first-time-since-financial-crisis). One can always doubt whether inversions are truly a harbinger of recessions, and [use the attached parable on yield curve inversions](https://twitter.com/5_min_macro/status/1161627360946511873).


In our case we will look at US data and use the [FRED database](https://fred.stlouisfed.org/) to download historical yield curve rates, and plot the yield curves since 1999 to see when the yield curves flatten. 

First, we will load the yield curve data file that contains data on the yield curve since 1960-01-01

```{r download_historical_yield_curve, warning=FALSE, cache=TRUE}

yield_curve <- read_csv(here::here("data", "yield_curve.csv"))

glimpse(yield_curve)
```

Our dataframe `yield_curve` has five columns (variables):

- `date`: already a date object
- `series_id`: the FRED database ticker symbol
- `value`: the actual yield on that date
- `maturity`: a short hand for the maturity of the bond
- `duration`: the duration, written out in all its glory!


## Plotting the yield curve 

We will produce the following three graphs!

### Yields on US rates by duration since 1960


---> YIELD GRAPH #1 <---

```{r yield_curve_1_exercise, echo=FALSE, out.width="100%", cache=TRUE}

#create a vector to order the durations
order <- c("3-Month Treasury Bill","6-Month Treasury Bill","1-Year Treasury Rate","2-Year Treasury Rate","3-Year Treasury Rate","5-Year Treasury Rate","7-Year Treasury Rate","10-Year Treasury Rate","20-Year Treasury Rate","30-Year Treasury Rate")

yield_curve %>%

#plot the graph
ggplot(aes(x=date, y=value, colour=duration))+
  
  #create a ligne graph and remove the legend
  geom_line(show.legend = FALSE)+
  
  #facet by maturity using the order we defined above and set the number of column per row to 2
  facet_wrap(~fct_relevel(duration, order),ncol=2)+
  
  #set the proper theme, titles and caption
  theme_bw()+
  labs(title="Yields on U.S. Treasury rates since 1960",
       y="Yield (%)",
       x="Maturity",
       caption="Source: St. Louis Federal Reserve Economic Database (FRED)")
```


### Monthly yields on US rates by duration since 1999 on a year-by-year basis

---> YIELD GRAPH #2 <---
```{r replicate_yield_curve_2, cache=TRUE}

#create a vector to order the maturities
order_2 <- c("3m","6m","1y","2y","3y","5y","7y","10y","20y","30y")

yield_curve_2 <- yield_curve %>%
  
  #selecting all the column except duration
  select(-c(series_id,duration))%>%
  
  #create new columns for date, year and month
  mutate(date=ymd(date),
         year=year(date),
         month=month(date)) %>%
  
  #filter for the year after 1999
  filter(year>=1999)

yield_curve_2 %>%
  
  #create a new column with the maturities order as set above with the vector we created
  mutate(maturity=fct_relevel(maturity,order_2))%>%
  
  #plot the graph
ggplot(aes(x=maturity, y=value, color=year))+
  
  #create a line graph, group by month and remove the legend 
  geom_line(aes(group=month),show.legend = FALSE)+
  
  #color the year with rainbow colours
  scale_color_gradientn(colors = rainbow(23))+
  
  #facet by year and set the column number to 4
  facet_wrap(~year,ncol=4)+
  
  #set the proper theme, titles and caption
  theme_bw()+
  labs(title="US Yield Curve",
       y="Maturity",
       x="Yield (%)",
       caption="Source: St. Louis Federal Reserve Economic Database (FRED)")

```

### 3-month and 10-year yields since 1999

---> YIELD GRAPH #3  <---
```{r yield_curve_3_exercise, out.width="100%", cache=TRUE}

yield_curve_2bis <- yield_curve %>%
  
  #create column for the date, year and month
  mutate(date=ymd(date),
         year=year(date),
         month=month(date)) %>%
  
  #filter for the year after 1999 and the maturities we are interested in
  filter(year>=1999,
         duration%in% c("3-Month Treasury Bill","10-Year Treasury Rate"))

yield_curve_2bis %>%
  
#plot the graph
ggplot(aes(x=date, y=value, colour=duration))+
  
  #create a line graph
  geom_line()+
  
  #set the proper theme, titles and caption
  theme_bw()+
  labs(title="Yields on 3-month and 10-year US Treasury rates since 1999",
       y="%",
       x="",
       caption="Source: St. Louis Federal Reserve Economic Database (FRED)")+
  
  #remove the legend title
  scale_color_discrete(name="")
```

>According to [Wikipedia's list of recession in the United States](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_recessions_in_the_United_States), since 1999 there have been two recession in the US: between Mar 2001–Nov 2001 and between Dec 2007–June 2009. Does the yield curve seem to flatten before these recessions? Can a yield curve flattening really mean a recession is coming in the US? Since 1999, when did short-term (3 months) yield more than longer term (10 years) debt?

The yield curve seems to flatten before the recession, and this can indicate a recession as can be clearly seen on the graphs during 1999 – 2000 and 2005 - 2006. There is a smaller yield differential between short and long-term debt, an anticipation of tighter monetary policy and economic uncertainty. Short-term yield was more than long term debt during August 2000 – December 2000 and August 2006 to April 2007.


Besides calculating the spread (10year - 3months), there are a few things we need to do to produce our final plot

1. Setup data for US recessions 
1. Superimpose recessions as the grey areas in our plot
1. Plot the spread between 30 years and 3 months as a blue/red ribbon, based on whether the spread is positive (blue) or negative(red)

- For the first, the code below creates a dataframe with all US recessions since 1946

```{r setup_US-recessions, warning=FALSE, cache=TRUE}

# get US recession dates after 1946 from Wikipedia 
# https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_recessions_in_the_United_States

recessions <- tibble(
  from = c("1948-11-01", "1953-07-01", "1957-08-01", "1960-04-01", "1969-12-01", "1973-11-01", "1980-01-01","1981-07-01", "1990-07-01", "2001-03-01", "2007-12-01","2020-02-01"),  
  to = c("1949-10-01", "1954-05-01", "1958-04-01", "1961-02-01", "1970-11-01", "1975-03-01", "1980-07-01", "1982-11-01", "1991-03-01", "2001-11-01", "2009-06-01", "2020-04-30") 
  )  %>% 
  mutate(From = ymd(from), 
         To=ymd(to),
         duration_days = To-From)

```{r yield_curve_4_exercise, out.width="100%", cache=TRUE}

  #select all the column except the duration variable
  select(-c(series_id,duration))%>% 
  
  #create a year column
  mutate(date=ymd(date), 
         year=year(date))%>%
  
  #filter for the maturities we will use to compute the yield difference
  filter(maturity %in% c("3m","10y")) 

yield_curve_5 <- yield_curve_4 %>%
  
  #make our data set wide with the two maturities we need to compute the difference

  mutate(diff = `10y` - `3m`) %>%

yield_curve_5 %>% 
  
#plot the graph
ggplot(aes(x=date, y=diff))+ 
  
  #create a line graph
  geom_line(show.legend = FALSE)+ 
  
  #grey the background areas during which the recessions occurred
  geom_rect(aes(xmin = as.Date("1960-04-01"),xmax = as.Date("1961-02-01"),ymin=-Inf,ymax=Inf), alpha=0.01, fill="gray")+

  #set the proper titles and caption
  theme_bw()+
    labs(title="Yield Curve Inversion: 10-year minus 3-month US Treasury rates",
    subtitle = "Difference in % points, monthly averages.\nShaded areas correspond to recessions.",
    y="Difference (10 year - 3 month) yield in %",
    x="",
    caption="Source: FRED, Federal Reserve Bank of St. Louis")+
  
  #remove the legend
  theme(legend.position = "none",
        legend.background=element_blank())
```

- To add the grey shaded areas corresponding to recessions, we use `geom_rect()`
- To colour the ribbons blue/red we must see whether the spread is positive or negative and then use `geom_ribbon()`.
