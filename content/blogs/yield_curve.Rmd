# Challenge 1: Yield Curve inversion

Every so often, we hear warnings from commentators on the "inverted yield curve" and its predictive power with respect to recessions. An explainer what a [inverted yield curve is can be found here](https://www.reuters.com/article/us-usa-economy-yieldcurve-explainer/explainer-what-is-an-inverted-yield-curve-idUSKBN1O50GA). If you'd rather listen to something, here is a great podcast from [NPR on yield curve indicators](https://www.podbean.com/media/share/dir-4zgj9-6aefd11)

In addition, many articles and commentators think that, e.g., [*Yield curve inversion is viewed as a harbinger of recession*](https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2019-08-14/u-k-yield-curve-inverts-for-first-time-since-financial-crisis). One can always doubt whether inversions are truly a harbinger of recessions, and [use the attached parable on yield curve inversions](https://twitter.com/5_min_macro/status/1161627360946511873).


```{r yield_curve_parable.jpg, echo=FALSE, out.width="100%", cache=TRUE}
knitr::include_graphics(here::here("images", "yield_curve_parable.jpg"), error = FALSE)
```


In our case we will look at US data and use the [FRED database](https://fred.stlouisfed.org/) to download historical yield curve rates, and plot the yield curves since 1999 to see when the yield curves flatten. If you want to know more, a very nice article that explains the [yield curve is and its inversion can be found here](https://fredblog.stlouisfed.org/2018/10/the-data-behind-the-fear-of-yield-curve-inversions/). At the end of this challenge you should produce this chart

```{r yield_curve_challenge, echo=FALSE, out.width="100%", cache=TRUE}
knitr::include_graphics(here::here("images", "yield_curve_challenge.png"), error = FALSE)
```


First, we will load the yield curve data file that contains data on the yield curve since 1960-01-01

```{r download_historical_yield_curve, warning=FALSE, cache=TRUE}

yield_curve <- read_csv(here::here("data", "yield_curve.csv"))

glimpse(yield_curve)
```

Our dataframe `yield_curve` has five columns (variables):

- `date`: already a date object
- `series_id`: the FRED database ticker symbol
- `value`: the actual yield on that date
- `maturity`: a short hand for the maturity of the bond
- `duration`: the duration, written out in all its glory!


## Plotting the yield curve

This may seem long but it should be easy to produce the following three plots

### Yields on US rates by duration since 1960

```{r yield_curve_1, echo=FALSE, out.width="100%", cache=TRUE}
knitr::include_graphics(here::here("images", "yield_curve1.png"), error = FALSE)
```

---> YIELD GRAPH #1 REPRODUCTION BELOW <---
```{r yield_curve_1_exercise, echo=FALSE, out.width="100%", cache=TRUE}

#create a vector to order the durations
order <- c("3-Month Treasury Bill","6-Month Treasury Bill","1-Year Treasury Rate","2-Year Treasury Rate","3-Year Treasury Rate","5-Year Treasury Rate","7-Year Treasury Rate","10-Year Treasury Rate","20-Year Treasury Rate","30-Year Treasury Rate")

yield_curve %>%

#plot the graph
ggplot(aes(x=date, y=value, colour=duration))+
  
  #create a ligne graph and remove the legend
  geom_line(show.legend = FALSE)+
  
  #facet by maturity using the order we defined above and set the number of column per row to 2
  facet_wrap(~fct_relevel(duration, order),ncol=2)+
  
  #set the proper theme, titles and caption
  theme_bw()+

```


### Monthly yields on US rates by duration since 1999 on a year-by-year basis


```{r yield_curve_2, echo=FALSE, out.width="100%", cache=TRUE}

yield_curve_2 <- yield_curve %>%
  
  #selecting all the column except duration
  select(-c(series_id,duration))%>%
  
  #create new columns for date, year and month
  mutate(date=ymd(date),
         year=year(date),
         month=month(date)) %>%
  
  #filter for the year after 1999
  filter(year>=1999)

yield_curve_2 %>%
  
  #create a new column with the maturities order as set above with the vector we created
  mutate(maturity=fct_relevel(maturity,order_2))%>%
  
  #plot the graph
ggplot(aes(x=maturity, y=value, color=year))+
  
  #create a line graph, group by month and remove the legend 
  geom_line(aes(group=month),show.legend = FALSE)+
  
  #color the year with rainbow colours
  scale_color_gradientn(colors = rainbow(23))+
  
  #facet by year and set the column number to 4
  facet_wrap(~year,ncol=4)+
  
  #set the proper theme, titles and caption
  theme_bw()+
  labs(title="US Yield Curve",
       y="Maturity",
       x="Yield (%)",
       caption="Source: St. Louis Federal Reserve Economic Database (FRED)")

```

### 3-month and 10-year yields since 1999

```{r yield_curve_3, echo=FALSE, out.width="100%", cache=TRUE}
knitr::include_graphics(here::here("images", "yield_curve3.png"), error = FALSE)
```
---> YIELD GRAPH #3 REPRODUCTION BELOW <---
```{r yield_curve_3_exercise, out.width="100%", cache=TRUE}

yield_curve_2bis <- yield_curve %>%
  
  #create column for the date, year and month
  mutate(date=ymd(date),
         year=year(date),
         month=month(date)) %>%
  
  #filter for the year after 1999 and the maturities we are interested in
  filter(year>=1999,
         duration%in% c("3-Month Treasury Bill","10-Year Treasury Rate"))

yield_curve_2bis %>%
  
#plot the graph
ggplot(aes(x=date, y=value, colour=duration))+
  
  #create a line graph
  geom_line()+
  
  #set the proper theme, titles and caption
  theme_bw()+
  labs(title="Yields on 3-month and 10-year US Treasury rates since 1999",
       y="%",
       x="",
       caption="Source: St. Louis Federal Reserve Economic Database (FRED)")+
  
  #remove the legend title

According to [Wikipedia's list of recession in the United States](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_recessions_in_the_United_States), since 1999 there have been two recession in the US: between Mar 2001–Nov 2001 and between Dec 2007–June 2009. Does the yield curve seem to flatten before these recessions? Can a yield curve flattening really mean a recession is coming in the US? Since 1999, when did short-term (3 months) yield more than longer term (10 years) debt?

--> OUR ANSWER BELOW <--

The yield curve seems to flatten before the recession, and this can indicate a recession as can be clearly seen on the graphs during 1999 – 2000 and 2005 - 2006. There is a smaller yield differential between short and long-term debt, an anticipation of tighter monetary policy and economic uncertainty. Short-term yield was more than long term debt during August 2000 – December 2000 and August 2006 to April 2007.

--> END OF OUR ANSWER <--

Besides calculating the spread (10year - 3months), there are a few things we need to do to produce our final plot

1. Setup data for US recessions 
1. Superimpose recessions as the grey areas in our plot
1. Plot the spread between 30 years and 3 months as a blue/red ribbon, based on whether the spread is positive (blue) or negative(red)

- For the first, the code below creates a dataframe with all US recessions since 1946

```{r setup_US-recessions, warning=FALSE, cache=TRUE}

# get US recession dates after 1946 from Wikipedia 
# https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_recessions_in_the_United_States

recessions <- tibble(
  from = c("1948-11-01", "1953-07-01", "1957-08-01", "1960-04-01", "1969-12-01", "1973-11-01", "1980-01-01","1981-07-01", "1990-07-01", "2001-03-01", "2007-12-01","2020-02-01"),

         To=ymd(to),
         duration_days = To-From)

              values_from = value) %>%
  
  #create a new column to obtain the difference bewteen the two maturities
  mutate(diff = `10y` - `3m`) %>%
  
  #create new columns to color the areas below and above the x=0 axis in respectively red and blue

  #remove the legend
  theme(legend.position = "none",
        legend.background=element_blank())
```

- To add the grey shaded areas corresponding to recessions, we use `geom_rect()`
- to colour the ribbons blue/red we must see whether the spread is positive or negative and then use `geom_ribbon()`. You should be familiar with this from last week's homework on the excess weekly/monthly rentals of Santander Bikes in London.

# Challenge 2: GDP components over time and among countries

At the risk of oversimplifying things, the main components of gross domestic product, GDP are personal consumption (C), business investment (I), government spending (G) and net exports (exports - imports). You can read more about GDP and the different approaches in calculating at the [Wikipedia GDP page](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gross_domestic_product).

The GDP data we will look at is from the [United Nations' National Accounts Main Aggregates Database](https://unstats.un.org/unsd/snaama/Downloads), which contains estimates of total GDP and its components for all countries from 1970 to today. We will look at how GDP and its components have changed over time, and compare different countries and how much each component contributes to that country's GDP. The file we will work with is [GDP and its breakdown at constant 2010 prices in US Dollars](http://unstats.un.org/unsd/amaapi/api/file/6) and it has already been saved in the Data directory. Have a look at the Excel file to see how it is structured and organised


```{r read_GDP_data, cache=TRUE}

UN_GDP_data  <- read_excel(here::here("data", "Download-GDPconstant-USD-countries.xls"), # Excel filename
                sheet="Download-GDPconstant-USD-countr", # Sheet name
                skip=2) # Number of rows to skip

```

The first thing you need to do is to tidy the data, as it is in wide format and you must make it into long, tidy format. Please express all figures in billions (divide values by `1e9`, or $10^9$), and you want to rename the indicators into something shorter.

```{r reshape_GDP_data, cache=TRUE}

#convert the data to long format
tidy_GDP_data  <-  pivot_longer(UN_GDP_data, cols = 4:51, #using the the columns 4 to 51 to make a long table
                                names_to = "Years",
                                values_to = "Values") 
                
#clean the data - values to billions, set the variables properly and rename indicators
tidy_GDP_data<- tidy_GDP_data %>% 
  mutate(Values=Values/10^9) %>%
  mutate(across(Years,as.numeric)) %>% #set "Years" as a numeric variable
  mutate(across(Country,as.character)) %>%
  rename(Indicator=IndicatorName) 

#check which indicators and countries to change
tidy_GDP_data %>% distinct(Indicator)
tidy_GDP_data %>% distinct(Country)

#we get an error message when recoding in pipe, so we use base R based on suggestions from StackOverFlow 
#the error we get is <<Error in UseMethod("recode") : no applicable method for 'recode' applied to an object of class "c('tbl_df', 'tbl', 'data.frame')">>

#rename the indicators using the recode function
tidy_GDP_data$Indicator <- recode(tidy_GDP_data$Indicator,

                                  "Transport, storage and communication (ISIC I)"="Transport",
                                  "Wholesale, retail trade, restaurants and hotels (ISIC G-H)"="Wholesale")

tidy_GDP_data <- tidy_GDP_data %>% 
  select("Country", "Indicator", "Years", "Values")

# Let us compare GDP components for these 3 countries
country_list <- c("United States","India", "Germany")

#creat a data frame filtered with the vector containing the three countries we want to compare
tidy_GDP_data_3 <- tidy_GDP_data %>%
  filter(Country %in% country_list)
```

First, can you produce this plot?


```{r gdp1, echo=FALSE, out.width="100%", cache=TRUE}
knitr::include_graphics(here::here("images", "gdp1.png"), error = FALSE)
```

```{r gdp1_plot, cache=TRUE, out.width="100%"}

#create the vector of the indicators we want 
indicator_list_1 <- c("Gross capital formation", "Exports", "Government expenditure", "Household expenditure", "Imports")

#selecting our tidy data frame that has been filtered for the Germany, India and the US
tidy_GDP_data_3 %>%
  
  #filter the indicators with the vector we created
  filter(Indicator %in% indicator_list_1) %>%
  
  #plot the graph with the right aesthetics
  ggplot(aes(x = Years, y = Values, colour = Indicator))+
  
  #group by indicator
  geom_line(aes(group=Indicator))+
  
  #facet by country and set the column number to 3
  facet_wrap(~Country,ncol=3)+
  
  #set the proper theme, titles and caption
  theme_bw()+
  labs(title="GDP components over time",
       subtitle = "In constant 2010 USD",
       color = "Components of  GDP",
       y="Billion US$",
       x="")
```

Secondly, recall that GDP is the sum of Household Expenditure (Consumption *C*), Gross Capital Formation (business investment *I*), Government Expenditure (G) and Net Exports (exports - imports). Even though there is an indicator `Gross Domestic Product (GDP)` in your dataframe, I would like you to calculate it given its components discussed above.

> What is the % difference between what you calculated as GDP and the GDP figure included in the dataframe?

            higher_ci_95=mean_change_india+t_critical*se_change_india)
  
  #compute statistics regarding the GDP difference for the US
  diff_US<- tidy_GDP_data_7 %>% 
    summarise(sample_size=n(),
            t_critical=qt(0.975,sample_size-1),
            mean_change_US=mean(`United States`),
            sd_change_US=sd(`United States`),
            se_change_US=sd_change_US/sqrt(sample_size),
            lower_ci_95=mean_change_US-t_critical*se_change_US,
            higher_ci_95=mean_change_US+t_critical*se_change_US)

#print the differences
diff_germany
diff_india
diff_US
```

From the above, we can see an average difference of 1.11% for Germany, 0.08% for India, and 1.24% for the US, which implies that either the governments typically released underestimates, or we are lacking additional data that would cause such consistent errors.

--> OUR ANSWER BELOW <--

Regarding Germany, household expenditure contributes the most to the Country’s GDP during 1970 to 2016 followed by exports and imports. The government expenditure and gross capital formation reported the same trends with a very small growth during the period. Concerning India, household expenditure also accounts the most of its GDP and showed an increasing trend since 1970.  Other contributors reported flat trends during 1970 to 2000 and started to grow after that. The U.S.’s GDP reported a substantially growth comparing to the other two countries especially on household expenditures that increased almost five times during the periods.

# Rubric

Check minus (1/5): Displays minimal effort. Doesn't complete all components. Code is poorly written and not documented. Uses the same type of plot for each graph, or doesn't use plots appropriate for the variables being analyzed. 

Check (3/5): Solid effort. Hits all the elements. No clear mistakes. Easy to follow (both the code and the output). 

Check plus (5/5): Finished all components of the assignment correctly and addressed both challenges. Code is well-documented (both self-documented and with additional comments as necessary). Used tidyverse, instead of base R. Graphs and tables are properly labelled. Analysis is clear and easy to follow, either because graphs are labeled clearly or you've written additional text to describe how you interpret the output.
