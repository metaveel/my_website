<p>At Chulalongkorn, I was able to secure <em>three</em> different internships: 1) Product and Investment Strategy Intern at Asset Plus Fund Management, 2) Summer Intern at Bualuang Securities, and 3) Segmentation Intern at Krungthai Bank Public Company Limited. Those internships helped me to realize that I would like to pursue a career that comprises of investment and corporate finance such as M&amp;A; therefore, I decided to join <em>9Basi</em>, a boutique PE firm with a focus on real estate and distressed assets in Thailand.</p>

I have come to LBS to explore opportunities to be connected with world-renowned PE firms, and amazing people throughout the School. I would also to share my network, and passion in investment to everyone!</p>
