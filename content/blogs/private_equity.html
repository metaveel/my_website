<h2><em>My biggest achievement</em></h2>
<p>I was a deal leader in both the second tranche acquisition of Ngern Tid Lor Public Company Limited (SET Ticker: TIDLOR) from CVC Capital Partners (Deal size $21m) and share purchase from the existing shareholder (Deal size $47m) before the Company went public. It is the first deal that I was a deal leader where I got opportunities to work with several stakeholders and be part of the deal from origination to execution. At the IPO price, 9Basil generated a return of 3.4x.</p>
