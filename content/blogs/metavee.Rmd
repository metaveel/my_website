## metavee luangthawornkul

Hello everyone! This blog is a combination of what I have learned in R from the Data Analytics course at LBS and my personal life experience. 

I am from Bangkok, Thailand. I graduated from *Chulalongkorn University* majoring in Financial Analysis and Investment. I also went for an exchange program at Nanyang Technological University, Singapore. 

At Chulalongkorn, I was able to secure three different internships: 1) Product and Investment Strategy Intern at *Asset Plus Fund Management*, 2) Summer Intern at *Bualuang Securities*, and 3) Segmentation Intern at *Krungthai Bank Public Company Limited*. Those internships helped me to realize that I would like to pursue a career that comprises of investment and corporate finance such as M&A; therefore, I decided to join *9Basi*, a boutique private equity firm with a focus on real estate and distressed assets in Thailand.

After working for two years, I have learned lifetime skills that match with my goal! I want a job where I could directly add value to the companies. Moreover, in current global situations, I perceive that it is the best timing for private equity. With the emergence of new companies and the disruption of existing companies, private equity can revolutionize the world and make an impact from unique areas.

Having always been passionate about investing and self-motivated, I decided to pursue my Masters in Financial Analysis (MFA) degree at London Business School. I perceive that MFA would equip me with a world-class education, professional network, and the best friendship!

I am religious yet nurtured to be open-minded to modernness. My hobby is meditation. I believe that the wholeness of presence helps me throughout any challenges in my life!
