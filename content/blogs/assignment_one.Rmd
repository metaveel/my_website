## My First R Assigment 

The following graphs are about the performance of DJIA and the methodologies regarding the process to reach each graphs. The work was part of my first R assignment I had done with my study group in Data Analytics for Finance course at LBS.

# Returns of financial stocks

We start off by downloading stock data from the New York Stock Exchange:

```{r load_nyse_data, message=FALSE, warning=FALSE, cache=TRUE}
nyse <- read_csv(here::here("data","nyse.csv"))
```

Then we create a table and a bar plot that shows the number of companies per sector, in descending order:

```{r companies_per_sector, cache=TRUE}
nyse %>% #We take the relevant dataset.
  group_by(sector) %>% #We group the companies listed on the NYSE by sector.
  summarise(sector_count = count(sector)) %>% #We summarise to count the number of companies by sector.
  arrange(desc(sector_count)) %>% #We arrange each sector by the number of companies in a descending order.
  kable() %>% #We format our table to make it more easily readable.
  kable_styling()

nyse %>% #We take the relevant dataset.
  group_by(sector) %>% #We group the companies listed on the NYSE by sector.
  summarise(sector_count = count(sector)) %>% #We summarise to count the number of companies by sector.
  ggplot(aes(x = sector_count, y = fct_reorder(sector, sector_count))) + #We plot the number of listed companies on the NYSE by sector, and colour and fill by sector to make the information more easily readable.
  geom_col()+ #We create a column graph.
  theme_bw()+
  labs(
    title = "Number of companies by sector listed on the NYSE",
    x = "Number of companies",
    y = NULL
  )+
#Finally, we format the main title, the axes' titles and the axes' text to make the chart more easily readable.
theme(plot.title = element_text(size = 14, face = "bold", hjust=.5), 
      axis.text=element_text(size=10), 
      axis.title.x = element_text(size = 12, angle = 0)) +
  NULL

```



We then use the [Dow Jones Industrial Aveareg (DJIA)](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dow_Jones_Industrial_Average) Wikipedia website to find the stocks comprising the index and their ticker symbols. We use this to and download stock data. In addition to the thirty stocks that make up the DJIA, we will also add `SPY` which is an SP500 ETF (Exchange Traded Fund).


```{r tickers_from_wikipedia, cache=TRUE}

djia_url <- "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dow_Jones_Industrial_Average"


#get tables that exist on URL
tables <- djia_url %>% 
  read_html() %>% 
  html_nodes(css="table")


# parse HTML tables into a dataframe called djia. 
# Use purr::map() to create a list of all tables in URL
djia <- map(tables, . %>% 
               html_table(fill=TRUE)%>% 
               clean_names())


# constituents
table1 <- djia[[2]] %>% # the second table on the page contains the ticker symbols
  mutate(date_added = ymd(date_added),
         
         # if a stock is listed on NYSE, its symbol is, e.g., NYSE: MMM
         # We will get prices from yahoo finance which requires just the ticker
         
         # if symbol contains "NYSE*", the * being a wildcard
         # then we jsut drop the first 6 characters in that string
         ticker = ifelse(str_detect(symbol, "NYSE*"),
                          str_sub(symbol,7,11),
                          symbol)
         )

# we need a vector of strings with just the 30 tickers + SPY
tickers <- table1 %>% 
  select(ticker) %>% 
  pull() %>% # pull() gets them as a sting of characters
  c("SPY") # and lets us add SPY, the SP500 ETF

```

Downloading prices for all 30 DJIA consituents and the SPY ETF that tracks SP500 since January 1, 2020

```{r get_price_data, message=FALSE, warning=FALSE, cache=TRUE}
# Notice the cache=TRUE argument in the chunk options. Because getting data is time consuming, # cache=TRUE means that once it downloads data, the chunk will not run again next time you knit your Rmd

myStocks <- tickers %>% 
  tq_get(get  = "stock.prices",
         from = "2020-01-01",
         to   = Sys.Date()) %>% # Sys.Date() returns today's price
  group_by(symbol) 

glimpse(myStocks) # examine the structure of the resulting data frame
```

Financial performance analysis depend on returns, so our first step is to calculate daily and monthly returns.


```{r calculate_returns, message=FALSE, warning=FALSE, cache=TRUE}
#calculate daily returns
myStocks_returns_daily <- myStocks %>%
  tq_transmute(select     = adjusted, 
               mutate_fun = periodReturn, 
               period     = "daily", 
               type       = "log",
               col_rename = "daily_returns",
               cols = c(nested.col))  

#calculate monthly  returns
myStocks_returns_monthly <- myStocks %>%
  tq_transmute(select     = adjusted, 
               mutate_fun = periodReturn, 
               period     = "monthly", 
               type       = "arithmetic",
               col_rename = "monthly_returns",
               cols = c(nested.col)) 

#calculate yearly returns
myStocks_returns_annual <- myStocks %>%
  group_by(symbol) %>%
  tq_transmute(select     = adjusted, 
               mutate_fun = periodReturn, 
               period     = "yearly", 
               type       = "arithmetic",
               col_rename = "yearly_returns",
               cols = c(nested.col))
```



**Creating a table summarizing monthly returns for each of the stocks and `SPY`**

```{r summarise_monthly_returns, cache=TRUE}
myStocks_returns_monthly %>% #We take the relevant dataset.
  group_by(symbol) %>% #We group the stocks by symbol.
  summarise(min=min(monthly_returns),max=max(monthly_returns),median=median(monthly_returns),mean=mean(monthly_returns),sd=sd(monthly_returns)) %>% #We summarise to obtain the minimum, maximum, median, mean and standard deviation of monthly returns.
  arrange(desc(mean)) %>% #We arrange the symbols by mean monthly returns.
#Finally, we format the main title, the axes' titles and the axes' text to make the chart more easily readable.
  kable() %>% 
  kable_styling()

```


## Density plot for each stock

**Creating a density plot, using `geom_density()`, for each of the stocks**

```{r density_monthly_returns, cache=TRUE}
myStocks_returns_monthly %>% #We take the relevant dataset.
  group_by(symbol) %>% #We group the stocks by symbol.
  ggplot(aes(x = monthly_returns)) + #We define the x-axis of our density plots.
  geom_density(aes(colour = symbol), alpha = 1) + #We create our density plots.
  facet_wrap(vars(symbol)) #We create a density plot for each stock symbol.

myStocks_returns_monthly %>% #We take the relevant dataset.
  group_by(symbol) %>% #We group the stocks by symbol.
  summarise(sd=sd(monthly_returns),mean = mean(monthly_returns),median = median (monthly_returns)) %>% #We summarise to obtain the median, mean and standard deviation of monthly returns.
  arrange(desc(sd)) %>% #We arrange stock symbols by descending order of SD of monthly returns to see which are the most and less risky ones.
#Finally, we format the charts to make them more easily readable.
  kable() %>% 
  kable_styling()
```



**What can we infer from this plot and which stock is the riskiest/least risky?**

From this plot and a table ranking the stock by the standard deviation of their monthly returns, we can see that the stock BA is the riskiest, whereas the stock VZ is the least risky.



## Plotting expected return and standard deviation

**Plot that shows the expected monthly return (mean) of a stock on the Y axis and the risk (standard deviation) in the X-axis**

```{r risk_return_plot, cache=TRUE}
# YOUR CODE GOES HERE
myStocks_returns_monthly %>%
group_by(symbol) %>%
summarise(M = mean(monthly_returns), S = sd(monthly_returns), color = symbol, label = symbol) %>%
ggplot(aes(x = S, y = M, label = symbol)) +
geom_text_repel(label=myStocks_returns_monthly$symbol,point.padding = NA,size=2,label.padding=0.05, segment.size=0.3)+
geom_point() +
theme_bw()+
labs(
  title = "Expected monthly return and risk proxy of each stock",
  x = "Standard deviation",
  y = "Expected return"
  )+
#Finally, we format the main title, the axes' titles and the axes' text to make the chart more easily readable.
theme(plot.title = element_text(size = 14, face = "bold", hjust = .5), 
      axis.text=element_text(size=10), 
      axis.title.x = element_text(size = 12, angle = 0), 
      axis.title.y = element_text(size = 12, angle = 90
  )) +
NULL
```

**What can you we infer from this plot? Are there any stocks which, while being riskier, do not have a higher expected return?**

The graph plots each stock's standard deviations against their expected returns. The stocks in the fourth quadrant (bottom right) of the graph have both the highest SD, hence the highest beta, and the lowest historic returns. We would expect these stocks to be poor investments, as they are those that bear the highest risk and the lowest expected returns.
